Farmers who grow potaotes face alot difficulties because of some diseases that hinder their activities. They are bssically two common types of disease;
Early blight that is caused by fongus and late blight that is caused by a micro organisms. If farmers could detect these diseases early enough, there could provide adequate treatment and this will have a positive economic change in their activity. The plan here is to use convolutional neural network to be able to to detect these disease at their early stages with the help of a picture of the leaf.
